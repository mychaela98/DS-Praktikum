# Getting-and-cleaning-data-project
A repository containing the files needed for the course project

# Files contained in the repository: 
1. A code book called `CodeBook.md` explaining the steps taken to tidy the raw data,
2. an R code called `run_analysis.R` with descriptions at every step, which can be launched by RStudio by importing the file, 
these include:
    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
3. the final tidy datasets, one `.txt` version and one `.csv` version - an output of the program.
